base case - some branch length; recursive case - length of branch getting smaller and smaller
the arguments for Tier 1 should be the length of the branch, and that's about it
Small Goal 1 - make the branches branch; Small Goal 2 - make sure the length gets smaller; Small Goal 3 - make sure it reaches the base case
